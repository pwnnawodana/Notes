High Availability
- Focuses on ensuring maximum availability and regardless of disruption or events may occur
- Azure is highly available cloud environment  with guarantee uptime depending on the service.
- These guarantee are part of service level agreement (SLAs)

Scalability
- ability to adjust resources to match the demand
- Scaling comes in generally two verities
	- vertical
		- focus on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of the resources
		- 
	- horizontal
		- adding or subtracting the number of resources

Reliability
- ability of a system to recover and continue to function

Predictability
- let you move forward with confidence
- can be focus on 
	- performance predictability
		- focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a better customer experience
		- Ex : 
			- Autoscaling : deploy additional resources on demand & scale back when demand drops
			- Load balancing : if the traffic heavily focused on one area then load balancing will help redirect some of the overloads to less stressed areas
			- High availability
	- cost predictability
		- predicting and forecasting the cost of cloud spend


Management of the cloud
- automatically deploy resources to match the demand 
- deploy resources using preconfigured templates which remove the manual process
- Monitor the health of the resources and automatically replace failing resources
- Receive automatic alert based on preconfigured metrics

Management in the cloud
- can manage cloud environment and resources suing
	- Through web portal
	- using CLI
	- using APIs
	- using PowerShell
