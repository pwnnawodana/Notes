- **Resources**: 
	- Resources are instances of services that you create, like virtual machines, storage, or SQL databases.
- **Resource groups**:	
	- Resources are combined into resource groups, which act as a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.
- **Subscriptions**: 
	- A subscription groups together user accounts and the resources that have been created by those user accounts. For each subscription, there are limits or quotas on the amount of resources that you can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, or projects.
- **Management groups**: 
	- These groups help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.

Special Azure regions
	Azure has specialized regions that you might want to use when you build out your applications for compliance or legal purposes. A few examples include:
	-  US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These regions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for U.S. government agencies and partners. These datacenters are operated by screened U.S. personnel and include additional compliance certifications.
	- China East, China North, and more: These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft doesn't directly maintain the datacenters.

Azure Availability Zone
	- Are physically separated datacenters within an azure region
	- minimum of three zones within a single region

Regional Pair
	- Each Azure region is always paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. 
	- If a region in a pair was affected by a natural disaster, for instance, services would automatically failover to the other region in its region pair.

Azure Resource Group and Resource Group Manager
	- **Resource**: A manageable item that's available through Azure. Virtual machines (VMs), storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks are examples of resources.
	- **Resource group**: A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization.

The benefits of using Resource Manager
	-   Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts. A Resource Manager template is a JSON file that defines what you want to deploy to Azure.
	-   Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.
	-   Redeploy your solution throughout the development life cycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
	-   Define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.
	-   Apply access control to all services because RBAC is natively integrated into the management platform.
	-   Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.
	-   Clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources that share the same tag.
	**Resource groups & tags helps to organize the resources neatly**

Azure Subscription Boundaries
	- **Billing boundary**: This subscription type determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure
		- Azure generate different billing report and invoices for each subscription
	- **Access control boundary**: Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level, and you can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures.

Creating additional subscriptions can initialize based on,
- environment for managing resources,
- Organizational Structures
- Billing
- Subscription limits as well

Customize Billing to Meet your Needs

Hierarchy of management groups and subscriptions
	
	![[Pasted image 20221115194317.png]]
	- can build a flexible structure of management groups and subscriptions to organize your resources into a hierarchy for unified policy and access management.
	- can create a hierarchy that applies a policy
	- 10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory
	- A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.
	- Azure subscription is a logical unit
