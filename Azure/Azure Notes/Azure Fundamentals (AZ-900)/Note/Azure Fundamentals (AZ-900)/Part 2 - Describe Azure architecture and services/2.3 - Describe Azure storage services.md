Describe Azure storage redundancy
- Azure storage always store copies of data
- Locally Redundant Storage
	- Replicate data 3 times within a single data center
	- 99.999999999% durability
	![[Pasted image 20221204141426.png]]
- Zone Redundant Storage
	- Replicate data 3 times with availability zone within primary region
	- 99.9999999999% durability
	![[Pasted image 20221204141942.png]]
- Redundancy in secondary region
	- once select primary region, the secondary region is based on azure pairs & cant change
	- offers 2 options to copying data to a secondary region
		- GRS : Geo Redundant Storage
			- Run LRS in 2 Regions
		- GZRS :  Geo Zone Redundant Storage
			- Run ZRS in primary & LRS in secondary region
	- By default the data in the secondary region isn't available for read write access unless there is a failover
- Geo-Redundant Storage
	- Replicate data 3 times with in primary region suing LRS and then copy data to secondary region asynchronously using LRS
	![[Pasted image 20221204145439.png]]
- Geo Zone Redundant Storage
	- High availability
	- Copied across 3 azure availability zones 
		- primary region using ZRS
		- Secondary region using LRS
	- 99.99999999999999% durability

Azure Storage Services
- types
	- Azure blob : for massive scalable objects (text, binary data)
		- Unstructured means no restrictions
		- Tiers
			- Hot : for data that access frequently
			- Cool : infrequently accessed and stored at least 30 days
			- Archive : rarely access and stores at least 180 days 
	- Azure File : managed file shares 
	- Azure Queue : a messaging store (for reliable messaging between applications components)
	- Azure Disk : block level storage volumes for azure VMs
- Benefits
	- Durable & High availability
	- Security
	- Scalable
	- Managed
	- Accessible

Azure Data Migration Options
- Azure Migrate
	- migrate from on premises environment to cloud
- Azure Databox
	- is a physical migration service that helps to transfer huge amount of data securely  and reliably
	- a physical device
	- Maximum usable storage capacity is 80TB
