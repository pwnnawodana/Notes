Physical infrastructure
	Datacenters are grouped in to azure regions or azure availability zones.
	Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases. Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:
		- Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
		- Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
		- Non-regional services: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.
	Region pairs
		Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. This approach allows for the replication of resources across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect an entire region. For example, if a region in a pair was affected by a natural disaster, services would automatically fail over to the other region in its region pair.

Azure Management Infrastructure
	A resource is a basic building block in azure 
	A resource can only in one resource group
	Resource can be move between resource group but when moved the resource no longer associated with former group
	When deleting resource group all nested resources will be deleted
	Management groups can be nested
