Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- directory service that enables to sign in and access both microsoft cloud services and cloud application that we develop.
- Also help to maintain on premises active directory deployment
- Can detect sign in attempts from unexpected locations or devices

Azure AD is for 
- IT Administrators
- App Developers
- Users
- Online Service Subscribers

What Azure AD do 
- Authentication
- Single Sign On (SSO)
- Application Management
- Device Management

**Azure Ad connect** allows to connect on premises AD to Azure AD


Azure Active Directory Domain Service
- manage domain services
- Cannot buy instead able to manage domain services
	- domain join
	- group policy
	- lightweight directory access

- Passwordless authentication options
	- Windows Hello for business
	- Microsoft Authenticator App
	- FIDO2 Security Keys (FIDO : Fast Identity Online)

	- Collaborate with external users by letting them use their preferred identity to Sign In to your microsoft applications or other enterprise applications.
- B2B Direct Connect
	- Establish a mutual, two way trust with another azure AD organization for seamless collaboration
- Azure AD Business to customer (B2C) 
	- Publish modern SaaS apps for custom applications to consumers or customers, while using AD B2C for identity and access management

RBAC (Role Based Access Control)
Role based access is applied to a scope. 
scope include
- A management group
- A single subscription
- A resource group
- A single Resources

Zero trust Environment
- Zero trust security model
	- verify explicitly : always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
	- use least access privilege
	- assume breach : minimize blast radius and segment access

Layers of defense
- Layers
	- Physical Security
	- Identity & Access
	- Perimeter
	- Network
	- Compute
	- Application
	- Data
