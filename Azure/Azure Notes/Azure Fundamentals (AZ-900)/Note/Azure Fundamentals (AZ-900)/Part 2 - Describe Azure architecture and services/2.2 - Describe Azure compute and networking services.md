Azure Virtual Machine
	VM provide IaaS 
	Total control over OS
	Ability to run custom software
	To use custom configuration
	VM availability set
		ensure that VM stagger updates and have varied powered and network connectivity, preventing from loosing all VMs with a single network or power failure 
		Machine availability set grouping VMs into two ways
			- Update Domain
				The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This allows you to apply updates while knowing that only one update domain grouping will be offline at a time. All of the machines in one update domain will be updated. An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts.
			- Fault Domain
				The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. By default, an availability set will split your VMs across up to three fault domains. This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in different fault domains (thus being connected to different power and networking resources).

Azure Virtual Desktop
	Also a virtual machine
	Allows desktop & application virtualization services on the cloud
	can access remote desktops or most modern browsers
	Advantages
		- provide centralized security
		- access data by assigning RBAC
		- Data and apps separated from the hardware
		- Can run actual desktop and apps in the cloud
		- User sessions are isolated in both single and multi session environments
	Cons
		- Seems like only can create for windows OS but can access VM on windows, mac, android and Linux clients

Azure Containers (PaaS)
	Run multiple instances of an application in a single host machine
	Azure container offer the fastest and simplest way to run container in azure (without having or managing virtual machine or adopt additional services )

Azure Functions
	Event driven serverless computing
	commonly use
		- response to an event timer
		- message from another azure service
		- work can be completed quickly within second or less
	Functions can be either
		- Stateless (default) 
			- Restart every time they respond to an event
		- Stateful
			- context is pass through the function to track priority

Application Hosting Options
	VM and containers provide excellent hosting options including maximum control to allow to configure exactly the way want. But
	Azure App Service
		enables to host and build web apps, background jobs, mobile backends, Restful API.
		offer automatic scaling and high availability
		Support windows and Linux
		It enable automatic deployment from GitHub, Azure DevOps or any other git repo to support continuous deployment model.
		Types of app services
			- Web Apps
				support ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python
				Either windows or Linux
			- API apps
				publish API, Have full swagger support
				Can consume by any HTTP or HTTPs based Client
			- Web Jobs
				to run a program (Ex: .exe, Java, PHP, Node, Python)
				to run a script (.cmd, .bat, PowerShell, Bash)
				often use to run background task as part of you application logic
			- Mobile Apps
				build backend for IOS or android mobile apps
					- Store mobile app data in a cloud-based SQL database.
					- Authenticate customers against common social providers, such as MSA, Google, Twitter, and Facebook.
					- Send push notifications.
					- Execute custom back-end logic in C# or Node.js.
				SDK support for native iOS and Android, Xamarin, and React native apps

Azure Virtual Network
	provide following networking capabilities
		- Isolation and segmentation
		- Internet communications
		- Communicate between Azure resources
		- Communicate with on-premises resources
		- Route network traffic
		- Filter network traffic
		- Connect virtual networks
	Not only connect to VM, rather azure resources, azure Kubernetes, azure VM scale sets etc.
	Communicate with on premises resources
		- Point to site
			- virtual private network connections are from a computer outside you organization back into corporate network
		- Site to Site
			- virtual private networks link your on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network
		- Azure ExpressRoute
	User-defined routes (UDR) allow you to control the routing tables between subnets within a virtual network or between virtual networks.

VPN Gateways
	- Policy based VPN Gateway
		- specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted  through each tunnel
	- In-Route based VPN Gateway, IPSec tunnels
		- decides which one of these tunnel interfaces to use when sending each package.
	Required when
		- Connection between virtual devices
		- Point to site connection
		- Multisite connection
		- Coexistence with an azure express route gateway
	High Availability Scenarios
		high availability, fault tolerance
		- Active / Standby
			- By default VPN gateways deployed as like this
			- When planned maintenance or unplanned interruption affect the active instance then the standby instance automatically assumes responsibility for connection without user interaction 
		- Active / Active
			- Assign unique IP address to each instance 
			- create separate tunnels form the on premises device to each IP address
			- Extend high availability by deploying additional VPN devices on-premises
		- Express Route Failover
			- Configure VPN gateway as a secure failover path for secure ExpressRoute connections.
			- When risk associate with an outage of an ExpressRoute circuit
		- Zone Redundant Gateways
			- In regions that support availability zones, VPN Gateways and ExpressRoute gateways can be deployed in a zone redundant configuration.
			- Brings resiliency, scalability, & higher availability to virtual network gateways

Azure Express Route
	- extend on premises network into the Microsoft cloud over a  private network ( with a help of connectivity provider )
	- With express route can establish a connection
		- microsoft dynamic 365
		- microsoft office 365
		- Azure compute service such as azure VMs
		- Azure cloud service such as cosmos DB and azure storage
	- Each location would have its own express route circuit
	- Connectivity can be from
		- Any to any (IP VPN)
		- Point to point ether network
		- virtual cross connection through a connectivity provider
		- Directly from express route sites
	- Express Route offer
		- Reliability
		- faster speeds
		- consistence latencies
		- Higher security than typical connection over the internet
	- Benefits of ExpressRoute
		- Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services across all regions in the geopolitical region.
		- Global connectivity to Microsoft services across all regions with the ExpressRoute Global Reach.
		- Dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft via Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
		- Built-in redundancy in every peering location for higher reliability.

Azure DNS
	Benefits of Azure DNS
		- Reliability & Performance
			- Azure DNS uses anycast networking, each DNS query answered by the closest available DNS server to provide fast performance and high availability for your domain
		- Security
			- RBAC
			- Activity logs, monitor users in organization modified resources
			- Resource locking to lock subscription, resource group... from accidently deleting or modifying 
		- Ease of use
		- Customizable Virtual Networks
		- Alias Records
